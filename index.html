      <h2>How To Play</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>Welcome to Traitor Chess! This game puts a little twist on the traditional game of chess.</p>
        <p>In Traitor Chess, after a set number of moves, one random piece from both white and black side will change color.
        The "Impending Doom" countdown tells you when this color change will take place.</p>
        <p>Currently the "check/mate" system is a work in progress but so far I have a temporary check system that restricts the king's moves.</p>
        <p>Because the check/mate system is not done yet, I implemented a back button in case you made an illegal move or mistake.
        However, there is pawn swap implemented for when you reach the end of the board as a pawn!</p>
        <p>To move pieces, first click on a piece and then click on the space you want to move to.
        If you can't seem to move your piece, open console by clicking 'F12' on your keyboard.
        When you click on the piece you want to move, it should show 'first click' and after you press the space
        you want to move the piece, it should show 'second click' and 'not a valid move' if its an illegal move.</p>
        <p>Hope you have fun playing!</p>
