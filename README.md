# Traitor Chess
Revolutionizing chess as we know it.

You never know who's going to betray you. Taking that to heart, I created Traitor Chess.

In Traitor Chess, after a set number of turns, one piece from both white and black side will change color (hence the traitor).
Classic chess strategies do not work as well here since the game constantly changes as it drags on.
